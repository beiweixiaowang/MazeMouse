# MazeMouse
This is the project pertaining to group 1052 from [DICE](http://dice.ase.ro/?lang=en_us) and coordinated by Prof. Claudiu Vinte.

## Main objectives
+ Fork the project and send Pull Requests in order to contribute to the project
+ Write clean tests and adhere to the standards, if there's something that can be improved make sure to improve it and leave the place clean (Boy Scout Rule)
+ If you cannot accomplish something or fix an already existing bug leave us a ticket
+ The tests are written with JUnit. [If you aren't familar](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Getting-started), this is a framework that eases the testing and can be very useful for driving the development
+ Tests [can be run from your IDE](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1381590) if you don't want to follow the command-line javac and java
